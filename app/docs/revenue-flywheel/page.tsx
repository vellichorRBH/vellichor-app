          Don&apos;t describe primary sale volume as &quot;protocol revenue&quot; — it isn&apos;t.
          If a pitch deck or landing page needs a revenue figure, it should be built from the two
          fee lines only (marketplace fee + custody fee), not gross transaction volume. Gross
          volume is a legitimate metric to show (it demonstrates activity), but it should never be
          labeled or implied as revenue.
