/// @title VellichorAgentPermission
/// @notice SKELETON / FRAMEWORK ONLY — not a finished, audited, or live system.
///         Lets a buyer grant a scoped, revocable permission to an AI agent address
///         to act ONLY on their own collateral position, and ONLY within the bounds
///         they set. This is the on-chain half of the "buyer-scoped AI agent" concept
///         (see vellichor-collateral-agent-concept.md) — it does not include the
///         agent itself (off-chain logic, whatever agent framework it eventually integrates with, etc.),
///         just the permission boundary the agent would have to operate within.
///
/// @dev CRITICAL DESIGN BOUNDARY: an agent granted permission here can NEVER touch
///      Vellichor's treasury, NEVER call team/owner-only functions on
///      VellichorVault.sol, VellichorMarket.sol, or VellichorGovernance.sol, and
///      NEVER act on any wallet other than the one that granted it permission. This
///      contract only tracks per-buyer, per-agent, per-action-type permission grants
///      — it does not itself execute anything against VellichorVaultUnitWrapper,
///      the Morpho market, or any collateral position. Wiring this up to actually
///      DO something (e.g. call repay() on a buyer's behalf) is a separate,
///      not-yet-built step — see the open questions in
///      vellichor-collateral-agent-concept.md, especially the unresolved
///      alert-only-vs-execute decision, before building that part.
///
/// @dev STATUS: skeleton only. Not integrated with any collateral contract. Not
///      audited. Not exposed in the app. See AGENT_STATUS.md.
