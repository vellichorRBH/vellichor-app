/// @notice Advisory governance for $VELL holders to signal support/opposition for
///         proposed bottle acquisitions. This is intentionally NOT a hard-lock —
///         it does not control VellichorVault.listBottle() in any way. The team
///         retains full discretion to acquire and vault bottles regardless of a
///         proposal's outcome here; this contract exists purely to give the
///         community a transparent, on-chain record of sentiment before the team
///         acts, not to bind or automate that action.
///
/// @dev IMPORTANT LIMITATION: $VELL (PonsLauncherToken.sol, live at
///      0x3d8C79bE2071CA84b0EfAe66E1437d9417ea4226) is a plain ERC20 and does NOT
///      implement checkpointed balances (OpenZeppelin's ERC20Votes pattern). Voting
///      weight here is therefore read via balanceOf() at the moment each vote is
///      cast, NOT a historical snapshot. This means a holder could in principle vote,
///      transfer their $VELL to another wallet, and vote again from that wallet — a
///      known, accepted limitation of the "hold" model chosen for $VELL (see
///      vellichor-vell-token.md). Do not use this contract for anything
///      higher-stakes than advisory bottle-acquisition sentiment unless a snapshot
///      mechanism is added.
